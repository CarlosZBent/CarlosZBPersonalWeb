                Hi there! My name is <strong>Carlos Zald√≠var Bent</strong>. I'm a programmer, writer and lawman from Cuba specialized in web development and Python. 
                I personally enjoy challenging projects and I'm tireless in the pursuit of my objectives
                and my teams'. I like to cooperate and assume responsibilities that make me grow as a person and as a developer, 
                always open to new experiences and to getting out of my comfort zone. I highly value any experience I get from my work. 

            </p>

    <div class="present_work">
        <p>
            As of October 26th 2021 <strong>I'm working on</strong> a startup web that I can't reveal more about for now. I'm also writing weekly 
            articles for <a href='https://www.kwelta.tech' target='_blank'>Kwelta.tech.</a> <br> I'm open to new oportunities though, 
            both as a software developer and as a writer.
